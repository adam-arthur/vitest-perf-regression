# Demonstration of performance bug in Vitest
- `npm run test` - observe that tests are instant
- `npm run test.reporter` - observe that tests are very slow

Notes:
This demo runs an autogenerated test suite with `expect(true).toBe(true)`. Only difference between the two cases is the reporter used. Enabling console based reporters significantly impairs vitest performance (orders of magnitude)
